   <h2>The Basics...</h2>
   <p>There 5 things you will be using on your vehicle. Those 5 things 
     <br>are: <b> throttle </b>, <b> clutch </b>, <b> shifter </b>, <b> rear brake </b> and the <b> front brake </b>
     <br>The throttle is what you use to accelerate and is attached to your right grip.
     <br>The clutch is activated by the left lever and is needed to shift gears
     <br>and can be used for more advanced tricks or tactics. The shifter should
     <br>be on the left side by your toe and is used to shift, you push down
     <br>to shift into first gear and the rest are usually upwards (the video
     <br>explains more in depth). The front brake is connected to your right
     <br>lever but shouldn't be used a lot as your primarily using your rear brake.
