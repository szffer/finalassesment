   <h2>The Basics...</h2>
   <p>There 5 things you will be using on your vehicle. Those 5 things are:
     <br> the throttle, the clutch, the shifter,the rear brake and the front brake.
     <br>The throttle is what you use to accelerate and is attached to your right grip,
     <br>The clutch is activated by the left lever and is what you use to go through gears
     <br>and can be used for raising your front tire, the front brake is on your right lever
     <br>but shouldn't be used a lot as your primarily using your rear brake.
