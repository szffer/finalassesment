      <!--A short paragraph discussing the essential parts of the dirt bike and the usage-->
      <p>
        There 5 things you will be using on your vehicle. Those 5 things
        <br />are: <b> throttle </b>, <b> clutch </b>, <b> shifter </b>,
        <b> rear brake </b> and the <b> front brake </b> <br />The throttle is
        what you use to accelerate and is attached to your right grip. <br />The
        clutch is activated by the left lever and is needed to shift gears
        <br />and can be used for more advanced tricks or tactics. The shifter
        should <br />be on the left side by your toe and is used to shift, you
        push down <br />to shift into first gear and the rest are usually
        upwards (the video <br />explains more in depth). The front brake is
        connected to your right <br />lever but
        <i>
          shouldn't be used a lot as your primarily using your rear brake.
        </i>
